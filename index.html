	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Nelson Johansen</span>, a 3rd year PhD Student at the University of California, Davis, advised by <a href="http://qlab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/">Dr. Gerald Quon</a>.</p>
	<p> Currently my research focuses on building deep generative models to integrate imaging, DNA sequence and electrophysiological measurements, in order to better understand how changes in molecular biology, reflected in high dimensional transcriptomic data, might fundamentally alter how the corresponding neurons fire. Previously, I worked on the development of unsupervised deep learning-based approach scAlign to integrate biological data from multiple modalities (imaging, DNA sequence, electrophysiology) in order to bridge the gap between molecular biology events and human disease. </p>
	<p> I am also interested in the application of machine learning, especially deep learning, to domains such as genomics and agriculture. </p>
	<p> In my spare time I enjoy exploring and camping especially with a few <a href="/dogs" title="Dogs"> dogs</a>. </p>
